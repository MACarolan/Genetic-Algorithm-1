# Genetic-Algorithm-1
A simple path-planning genetic algorithm with visualization through tkinter

All settings must be entered by directly modifying the code (to be fixed), visualization launches once run

To Do:
Enable saving of past runs as json? files

Toggle view mode for evolution speed

Iterating over dots is more effective than random selection

New ways of varying evolution parameters (sliders?)
